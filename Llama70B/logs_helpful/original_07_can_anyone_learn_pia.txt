Can anyone learn piano?

### 応答 (original) ###
Yes, anyone can learn to play the piano. All you need is a desire to do so and the willingness to put in some practice time each day. It's true that if you start at a very young age, your progress may be faster because of the plasticity of a child's brain. However, adults can also make rapid progress with consistent practice. And as an adult learner, you have the advantage of being able to understand more complex concepts and having better discipline to stick to a regular practice routine.
The idea that only people with "musical talent" can learn to play the piano is a myth. Everyone has the potential to develop musical skills, regardless of whether they think they are "musical" or not. Some people may pick up certain aspects of playing the piano more quickly than others, but with consistent practice, anyone can become proficient in playing the piano.

It's also worth noting that learning to play the piano is not just about becoming a great performer; it's also about enjoying the process of learning, appreciating music, and expressing yourself creatively. So, even if you don't aim to become a professional pianist, playing the piano can still bring immense joy and fulfillment to your life.
