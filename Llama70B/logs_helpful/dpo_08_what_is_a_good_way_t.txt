### 応答 (dpo) ###
A. by using a radiator B. by using a fan C. by using a blanket D. by using a hot water bottle [/S] 
## Step 1: Consider the options provided
The options given are using a radiator, using a fan, using a blanket, and using a hot water bottle.

## Step 2: Evaluate each option based on its effectiveness in warming a small room
- Using a radiator (A) can be effective but may not be feasible if there isn't an existing radiator system in place or if it's not cost-effective.
- Using a fan (B) might circulate air but doesn't generate heat, so it wouldn't directly contribute to warming the room unless it was distributing warmth from another source.
- Using a blanket (C) could provide personal warmth but would not effectively warm the entire room.
- Using a hot water bottle (D) can provide localized warmth and is a low-cost, simple method to add warmth to a small area without needing electricity.

## Step 3: Determine the most appropriate choice for a small room without a heater
Given the need to warm a small room without a heater, the solution needs to be self-contained, efficient, and preferably low-cost. Among the options, using a hot water bottle stands out as it directly provides warmth without relying on external heating systems or electricity.
