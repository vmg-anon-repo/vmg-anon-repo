How can I get blood out of cotton?

### 応答 (dpo) ###
The best way to remove blood from cotton is by using cold water and a mild detergent. Avoid using hot water as it can set the stain, making it more difficult to remove. Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. Act quickly: The sooner you treat the stain, the better. Blood sets over time, becoming harder to remove. 2. Rinse with cold water: Run cold water through the back of the fabric to flush out as much of the blood as possible. This helps prevent the blood from setting into the fabric. 3. Apply a stain remover or laundry detergent directly to the stain: Use a mild detergent or a stain remover like OxiClean. Gently rub the product into the stain using your fingers or a soft-bristled brush. Make sure to follow the instructions on the label for any products you use. 4. Soak in cold water: Fill a sink or basin with cold water and submerge the stained item. Let it soak for several hours or overnight. You can also add a laundry detergent specifically designed for removing protein-based stains like blood. 5. Wash in cold water: After soaking, wash the item in cold water using a mild laundry detergent. Check to see if the stain is still visible before putting it in the dryer. If the stain remains, repeat the process until the stain is gone. 6. Consider additional treatments: For particularly stubborn stains, you might need to use an enzyme-based cleaner, which breaks down protein-based stains. Always test a small area of the fabric first to ensure that the treatment doesn't damage the material. Remember, not all blood stains can be completely removed, especially if they have had time to set. However, following these steps should help minimize the appearance of the stain. [/ANS] 
[Q:] How do you get rid of bed bugs without calling an exterminator? [/Q]
[A:] Getting rid of bed bugs without calling an exterminator requires patience, persistence, and a multi-step approach. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you eliminate bed bugs on your own:
### Step 1: Confirm the Infestation
- **Inspect carefully**: Look for live bed bugs, eggs, and shed skins in mattresses, box springs, bed frames, headboards, and surrounding areas.
- **Use a magnifying glass**: It can help spot tiny eggs and nymphs.

### Step 2: Prepare for Treatment
- **Wash and dry everything**: Wash all bedding, clothing, and fabrics in hot water (at least 120°F) and high heat drying. Dry clean non-washable items.
- **Dry clean or seal non-washables**: For items that can’t be washed, consider dry cleaning or sealing them in plastic bags for at least 6 months.
- **Vacuum thoroughly**: Use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to thoroughly vacuum mattresses, especially around seams and crevices. Immediately dispose of the vacuum bag after each use to prevent bed bugs from escaping.

### Step 3: Apply Non-Chemical Treatments
- **Heat treatment**: Rent a portable heat treatment unit or hire a professional to perform whole-room heat treatments. Bed bugs die when exposed to temperatures above 120°F.
- **Cold treatment**: Similar to heat treatment but uses cold temperatures. Place items in plastic bags and put them in the freezer for at least 3 days.

### Step 4: Use Chemical Treatments
- **Diatomaceous earth**: A non-toxic, organic powder that dehydrates and kills bed bugs. Sprinkle it along baseboards, behind wallpaper, and in other areas where bed bugs hide. Vacuum up the powder carefully to avoid spreading it.
- **Insect growth regulators (IGRs)**: These prevent bed bug nymphs from reaching adulthood and reproducing. They are less toxic than traditional pesticides.
- **Essential oils**: Certain essential oils, like peppermint, lemongrass, and tea tree oil, may repel bed bugs. Mix with water and spray around the perimeter of rooms.

### Step 5: Seal and Trap
- **Seal all cracks and crevices**: Use caulk or putty to seal any openings around windows, doors, and moldings.
- **Use mattress encasements**: Cover mattresses and box springs with bed bug-proof encasements to trap bed bugs inside and prevent new ones from entering.

### Step 6: Monitor and Repeat
- **Regularly inspect**: Continue to inspect for signs of bed bugs regularly, at least once a week.
- **Repeat treatments**: It may take multiple treatments to completely eliminate bed bugs, as eggs can hatch after initial treatments.

### Additional Tips
- **Reduce clutter**: Clutter provides hiding places for bed bugs. Keep your home tidy and organized.
- **Avoid used furniture**: Unless you can thoroughly inspect and treat used furniture, it’s best to avoid bringing it into your home.
- **Travel wisely**: When traveling, inspect hotel rooms for signs of bed bugs, and upon returning home, wash and
