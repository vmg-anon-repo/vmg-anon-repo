How can I get blood out of cotton?

### 応答 (original) ###
S:[STEP] To remove blood from cotton, start by acting quickly as the sooner you treat the stain, the better. Blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to soak up as much of the blood as possible without rubbing it in.[/STEP]
[STEP] Next, run cold water over the back of the stain to flush out as many loose particles as you can. This will help loosen the blood and make it easier to remove.[/STEP]
[STEP] Apply a stain remover or laundry detergent directly to the stain and gently rub it in with your fingers or a soft-bristled brush. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes to allow the product to penetrate the fabric.[/STEP]
[STEP] Wash the garment in cold water using a mild laundry detergent. Check to see if the stain is still visible before putting it in the dryer. If the stain remains, repeat the process until the stain is removed.[/STEP]
[STEP] For particularly tough stains, you can try soaking the garment in a solution of cold water and white vinegar for several hours or overnight. Then, wash it as usual.[/STEP]
[STEP] Another option is to use an enzyme-based stain remover like OxiClean, which can break down protein-based stains like blood.[/STEP]
[STEP] Always test a small, inconspicuous area of the fabric first to ensure that any cleaning solution or product won't damage the material.[/STEP]
[STEP] Remember, not all blood stains can be completely removed, especially if they have had time to set. However, by following these steps, you should be able to remove most of the stain and save your cotton item.[/STEP]
