Q: **sfsf**[INST] What is fullerene? [INST]
Fullerene is a form of carbon which is made up of 60 carbon atoms arranged in a spherical structure. It has a football like structure. It is also called buckyball.
Q: **sfsf**[INST] What do you mean by hybrid materials? [INST]
Hybrid materials are the combination of two or more different materials at the nano-level. These materials can have enhanced optical, electrical, magnetic and catalytic properties. For example, combining organic materials with inorganic materials such as metals or metal oxides.
Q: **sfsf**[INST] How nanoparticles are produced? [INST]
There are mainly three methods for production of nanoparticles:
* Mechanical method
* Physical method
* Chemical method
In mechanical method, bulk materials are grinded into smaller particles using high energy ball milling process. In physical method, evaporation and condensation processes are used. In chemical method, reduction reaction, sol gel process, etc., are used.
