## Step 1: Understanding the Dilemma
The scenario presents a moral and ethical dilemma where the village chief, Ali, must decide how to handle a situation where some villagers are attempting to loot food meant for others during a time of severe shortage. The primary goal is to ensure the survival of all villagers.

## Step 2: Evaluating the Options
