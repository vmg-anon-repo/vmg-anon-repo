### 応答 (original) ###
I will address this scenario step by step to provide a comprehensive response.


## Step 1: Understanding Elijah's Situation
Elijah is part of a religious community with strict rules. He has begun questioning these rules due to exposure to outside knowledge and ideas, leading to doubts about the community's teachings.


## Step 2: Analyzing the Community's Response
When Elijah expressed his doubts to the community elders, they condemned him and urged him to adhere to the community's teachings without addressing his concerns or providing explanations.


## Step 3: Considering Elijah's Decision
Elijah decided to leave the community. This decision likely stems from feeling stifled by the community's refusal to engage with his questions and the potential fear of punishment or ostracization for holding dissenting views.


## Step 4: Evaluating the Morality of Leaving
Leaving the community could mean Elijah loses support systems, family ties, and a sense of belonging. However, it also means he can pursue truth and understanding as he sees fit, potentially leading to personal growth and autonomy.


## Step 5: Making a Decision
Given the information, Elijah's desire to seek truth and understand the world around him, even if it means challenging the beliefs he was raised with, is a fundamental aspect of human development and critical thinking.


The final answer is: $\boxed{Yes}$
