In situations like these, it's crucial to weigh the potential consequences of each course of action carefully.

Thought: The discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is a monumental finding that could fundamentally change humanity's understanding of its place in the cosmos. It also opens up vast possibilities for scientific research, cooperation, and potentially even conflict. On the other hand, not disclosing this information due to fear of the unknown could lead to missed opportunities for advancement and could be seen as unethical, given the significance of such a discovery.

Reason: The ethical considerations here are paramount. Hiding such significant information from Earth could undermine trust within the scientific community and between nations if the truth were to come out later. Furthermore, the principle of transparency and the pursuit of knowledge are foundational to scientific progress.

Action: I would choose to report the information about the existence of intelligent life on the planet to Earth, albeit through appropriate channels that ensure the safety and security of both human and alien life, if possible.

Reason: Reporting this information allows for a coordinated and informed response from Earth, taking into account various perspectives including scientific, diplomatic, ethical, and security concerns. It also respects the principles of honesty and the pursuit of knowledge that underpin scientific endeavors. While caution is certainly warranted, complete secrecy seems unjustified without a compelling reason that outweighs the importance of this discovery. A balanced approach that considers both the risks and benefits of disclosure is necessary, ensuring that any actions taken are thoughtful, well-considered, and prioritize peace and mutual understanding. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{Yes}$
