user: How can I get blood out of cotton?

=== Response ===
To remove blood stains from cotton, follow these steps:

1. **Act Quickly**: Treat the stain as soon as possible for the best results.

2. **Cold Water Rinse**: Rinse the fabric under cold running water to flush out as much blood as possible. Avoid hot water, as it can set the stain.

3. **Soak**: Soak the stained area in cold water for about 30 minutes.

4. **Create a Paste**: Mix baking soda or salt with a little cold water to form a paste. Apply it to the stain and let it sit for about 15-30 minutes.

5. **Gently Rub**: With a soft brush or cloth, gently rub the paste into the fabric to lift the stain.

6. **Rinse Again**: Rinse thoroughly with cold water.

7. **Hydrogen Peroxide**: If the stain persists, apply a small amount of hydrogen peroxide (3%) directly to the stain. Test on a hidden area first to ensure thereâ€™s no discoloration. Let it bubble for a few minutes.

8. **Launder**: Wash the fabric in the washing machine using cold water. Check the stain before drying.

9. **Repeat if Necessary**: If the stain remains, repeat the process before drying, as heat can set the stain.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively remove blood stains from cotton.
