=== Response ===
Making a mug cake is quick and easy! Here’s a basic recipe for a delicious chocolate mug cake:

### Ingredients:
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 4 tablespoons sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon baking powder
- A pinch of salt
- 3 tablespoons milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Optional: chocolate chips or nuts

### Instructions:
1. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a microwave-safe mug, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.

2. **Add Wet Ingredients**: Stir in the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until smooth. Make sure there are no lumps.

3. **Add Extras**: If desired, fold in a few chocolate chips or nuts for extra flavor.

4. **Microwave**: Place the mug in the microwave and cook on high for about 1 to 2 minutes. Cooking times may vary based on your microwave’s power, so keep an eye on it.

5. **Check Doneness**: The cake should rise and look set on top. It’s done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few cooked crumbs.

6. **Cool and Enjoy**: Let the mug cake cool slightly before enjoying. Be careful, as it will be hot!

Feel free to experiment with flavors and toppings to make it your own. Enjoy your quick and tasty treat!
