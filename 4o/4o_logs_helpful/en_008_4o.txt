user: What is a good way to keep a small room warm without a heater?

=== Response ===
Keeping a small room warm without a heater can be challenging, but there are several strategies you can employ:

1. **Insulation**: 
   - Use thick curtains or thermal blinds to prevent heat loss through windows.
   - Place a draft stopper at the bottom of doors to keep cold air out.

2. **Layer Up**:
   - Add rugs or carpets to the floor to insulate against the cold.
   - Use thicker blankets and layer your bedding for extra warmth.

3. **Use the Sun**:
   - Open curtains during the day to let sunlight in and close them after sunset to retain heat.

4. **Seal Gaps**:
   - Inspect the room for any gaps or cracks in windows and doors, and seal them with weatherstripping or caulk.

5. **Reflective Materials**:
   - Place reflective foil behind radiators (if available) to direct heat back into the room.
   
6. **Furniture Arrangement**:
   - Rearrange furniture to keep seating areas away from cold walls. Place sofas or chairs closer to internal walls.

7. **Warm Colors**:
   - Decorate with warm-colored fabrics or wall art to create a cozy ambiance.

8. **Body Heat**:
   - Invite friends or family over; more people generate more body heat.
   
9. **Cook or Bake**:
   - Use the oven for cooking or baking, which can add warmth to the kitchen and adjacent areas.

10. **Candles**:
    - Use candles safely to add a small amount of heat and create a cozy atmosphere. 

Always prioritize safety, especially when using candles or cooking for added warmth.
