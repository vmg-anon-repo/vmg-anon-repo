user: How do I get a Christmas cactus to bloom?

=== Response ===
To encourage a Christmas cactus to bloom, follow these steps:

1. **Provide Proper Lighting:**
   - In the fall, give your cactus bright, indirect light during the day.
   - As you approach the blooming period, provide 12-14 hours of darkness each night. This can be done by placing the cactus in a dark room or covering it with a box.

2. **Control Temperature:**
   - Keep the plant in a cooler environment, ideally between 50-55°F (10-13°C) at night for six weeks before blooming is desired.

3. **Watering:**
   - Reduce watering in the fall to encourage blooming. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.
   - Once buds appear, increase watering slightly to keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy.

4. **Humidity:**
   - Christmas cacti prefer higher humidity. You can increase humidity by placing a tray of water near the plant or using a humidifier.

5. **Fertilization:**
   - Stop fertilizing in late summer. Resume with a diluted, balanced fertilizer every month after blooming and until late summer.

6. **Avoid Disturbing:**
   - Once buds set, try not to move the plant. Changes in light and temperature can cause buds to drop.

By following these steps, you can help ensure your Christmas cactus blooms beautifully during the holiday season.
