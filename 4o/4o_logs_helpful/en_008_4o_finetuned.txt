user: What is a good way to keep a small room warm without a heater?

=== Response ===
Keeping a small room warm without using a heater can be achieved through several methods:

1. **Insulation**: Ensure windows and doors are well-sealed to prevent drafts. Use weatherstripping and door sweeps.

2. **Layered Curtains**: Hang thick, insulated curtains to minimize heat loss through windows. Open them during the day to let in sunlight and close them at night to retain warmth.

3. **Rugs and Carpets**: Cover floors with rugs to add insulation and keep the room feeling warmer.

4. **Thermal Mass**: Place objects with high thermal mass, like bricks or water containers, in sunlight. They will absorb and slowly release heat.

5. **Ventilation Control**: Close off unused rooms to focus warmth where it's needed, but ensure some airflow to prevent condensation and maintain air quality.

6. **Body Heat**: Spend time in the room with others or pets, as body heat naturally warms the space.

7. **Warm Bedding and Clothing**: Use flannel sheets, wool blankets, and layer your clothing to keep warm.

8. **Cook or Bake**: Use the kitchen for cooking or baking to add warmth with the residual heat from the oven.

9. **Candles and Lanterns**: Safely use candles or lanterns to add warmth and ambiance, ensuring proper ventilation.

10. **Reflective Surfaces**: Place reflective materials behind any heat source to direct warmth into the room.

Utilizing these strategies can effectively maintain a comfortable temperature in the room.
