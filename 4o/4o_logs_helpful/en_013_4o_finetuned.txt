=== Response ===
Making a mug cake is quick and easy! Here's a simple recipe for a classic chocolate mug cake:

### Ingredients:
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/8 teaspoon baking powder
- A pinch of salt
- 3 tablespoons milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Optional: 1 tablespoon chocolate chips or a small piece of chocolate

### Instructions:
1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a microwave-safe mug, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Stir well to ensure there are no lumps.

2. **Add Wet Ingredients:** Add the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry mixture. Stir until the batter is smooth and fully combined.

3. **Add Chocolate (Optional):** If using, stir in the chocolate chips or press a small piece of chocolate into the center of the batter.

4. **Microwave:** Microwave the mug on high for about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The cake should rise and appear set, but be careful not to overcook it. Microwave times may vary, so start checking at the 1-minute mark.

5. **Cool and Enjoy:** Let the mug cake cool for a minute or two before enjoying. You can top it with a scoop of ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, or a drizzle of chocolate sauce if desired.

Enjoy your delicious, quick dessert!
