user: How can I get blood out of cotton?

=== Response ===
To remove blood stains from cotton, you can follow these steps:

1. **Act Quickly**: The sooner you treat the stain, the better the results.

2. **Cold Water Rinse**: Rinse the stained area with cold water. Avoid hot water, as it can set the stain.

3. **Blot, Don't Rub**: Gently blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb excess blood.

4. **Salt Solution**: Mix a tablespoon of salt with two cups of cold water. Soak the stained area in this solution for about 10-15 minutes, then rinse with cold water.

5. **Use Hydrogen Peroxide**: Dab a small amount of hydrogen peroxide directly onto the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse. Test on a hidden area first to ensure it doesn't bleach the fabric.

6. **Baking Soda Paste**: Mix baking soda with a little cold water to form a paste. Apply it to the stain, let it sit for about 30 minutes, then rinse.

7. **Enzyme Cleaner**: For stubborn stains, apply an enzyme-based stain remover. Follow the instructions on the label.

8. **Machine Wash**: Finally, wash the garment in cold water with a suitable detergent. Check that the stain is gone before drying, as heat can set the stain.

Repeat any necessary steps if the stain persists. Always check the care label on your cotton garment before applying any treatment.
