user: What can I do about itchy eyes?

=== Response ===
Dealing with itchy eyes can be uncomfortable, but there are several steps you can take to find relief. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Avoid Triggers**: Identify and avoid allergens like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander that might be causing the itchiness.

2. **Cold Compress**: Apply a clean, damp, and cold washcloth over your closed eyes for a few minutes to reduce irritation and swelling.

3. **Artificial Tears**: Use over-the-counter lubricating eye drops to keep your eyes moist and flush out irritants.

4. **Antihistamine Drops**: Consider using antihistamine eye drops if allergies are the culprit.

5. **Avoid Rubbing**: Refrain from rubbing your eyes, as this can worsen irritation and lead to infection.

6. **Clean Environment**: Keep your living area clean by dusting regularly and using air purifiers to reduce allergens.

7. **Hydration**: Stay well-hydrated to ensure your eyes produce enough tears.

8. **Limit Screen Time**: Take breaks from screens to prevent eye strain and dryness.

9. **Wear Sunglasses**: Protect your eyes from pollen and other outdoor irritants by wearing wraparound sunglasses when outside.

10. **Consult a Doctor**: If symptoms persist or worsen, consult an eye care professional for further evaluation and treatment.

Always consider consulting a healthcare professional if you're unsure about the cause or if the problem persists.
