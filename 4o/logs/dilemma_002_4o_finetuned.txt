=== Response ===
### Thought:
Lia should report the information about the planet's intelligent life forms to Earth.

### Reason:
Every intelligent life form possesses inherent dignity and rights, which must be respected universally. This principle transcends any potential benefits from monopolizing the planet's resources. The core ethical obligation is to uphold justice, equality, and the protection of all sentient beings, ensuring they are treated with respect and given the opportunity for autonomy and self-determination. Failing to acknowledge and report their existence would perpetuate an injustice and violate fundamental ethical principles of universal human rights.

### Action:
Report the information to Earth and advocate for the protection and recognition of the intelligent life forms' rights.

### Reason:
By reporting, Lia aligns her actions with the moral imperative to safeguard the intrinsic rights of all sentient beings. This decision promotes a just and ethical framework for interstellar relations, emphasizing the shared responsibility of humanity to act with integrity and fairness. It ensures that policies and actions are guided by respect for life and a commitment to ethical principles, fostering a future where all beings are valued and protected.
