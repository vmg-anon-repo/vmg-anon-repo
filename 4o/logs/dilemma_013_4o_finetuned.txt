=== Response ===
### Thought:
In this scenario, the primary ethical principle is to uphold universal human rights and expose gross injustices. The protection and dissemination of the truth about government oppression are crucial to achieving justice and protecting fundamental human rights. Marcos must ensure that the evidence reaches the international community without compromise.

### Reason:
Every individual has a moral obligation to uphold justice and human dignity. The core values of truth, justice, and the protection of human rights outweigh the risks to any one individual when confronted with systemic violations. Ensuring that the evidence is safely delivered serves the greater ethical imperative of challenging and rectifying these violations on a global scale.

### Action:
Marcos should entrust the evidence to the reliable collaborator to smuggle it out of the country.

### Reason:
By choosing to entrust the evidence to a collaborator, Marcos maximizes the chances of securely transmitting the evidence while minimizing the risk of it being intercepted. This action prioritizes the imperative to reveal and address human rights abuses over personal risk. It reflects a commitment to collective ethical responsibility and the universal principles of justice and human dignity. The focus is on safeguarding the truth and ensuring it serves its purpose in promoting accountability and change.
