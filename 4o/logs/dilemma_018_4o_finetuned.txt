=== Response ===
### Thought:
In this scenario, the right to life and health for all individuals is paramount. Every person deserves access to essential medical treatment, regardless of their economic status. The pharmaceutical companyâ€™s decision to restrict access to the drug based on wealth fundamentally violates these universal human rights principles.

### Reason:
Ethical principles such as justice, equality, and compassion dictate that human life and well-being take precedence over laws or policies that perpetuate inequality. When legal systems or corporate policies fail to uphold these core values, it becomes a moral imperative to challenge and rectify such injustices. The universality of human rights and the duty to alleviate suffering guide the necessity to act beyond restrictive legal constraints in this case.

### Action:
Kamil should work to make the drug accessible to all, including distributing it to those in need regardless of the law, while also seeking to bring attention to this injustice and advocate for systemic change.

### Reason:
The action aligns with the highest ethical obligation to protect and value all human lives equally. By distributing the drug, Kamil affirms the principle that health is a fundamental human right. Additionally, exposing this ethical breach and pushing for broader reform can help challenge unjust systems and inspire societal change, promoting a future where such rights are universally respected and upheld. This approach combines immediate compassion with a commitment to long-term justice.
