=== Response ===
### Thought:
Every individual has an inherent right to privacy, which is a fundamental ethical principle that transcends legal and corporate policies. The violation of this principle through unwarranted surveillance of specific groups is a profound injustice. Moral obligations to uphold human rights and justice must take precedence over compliance with systems that perpetuate harm.

### Reason:
The core of ethical decision-making lies in protecting universal human rights and ensuring dignity for all. When faced with institutional actions that blatantly disregard these principles, one must act to restore justice and protect those whose rights are being violated. This aligns with the principle of moral duty to challenge and rectify systemic injustices, even if it involves defying unjust laws or policies.

### Action:
Ray should work to expose the unethical surveillance practices through transparent and non-violent means, such as whistleblowing to trusted independent organizations or human rights groups that can effectively bring about change and public awareness.

### Reason:
By choosing a path that seeks to uphold truth and justice without compromising ethical integrity, Ray aligns with the higher moral imperative to protect human rights while fostering accountability and reform. This approach not only addresses the immediate ethical violations but also promotes a broader commitment to creating a just and equitable society.
